# tccore_plugin :

Commanders Act's base TCCore library bridge.

This bridge is utilized by other libraries as a dependency, [TCConsent](https://github.com/CommandersAct/tcconsent-flutter-plugin) & [TCServerSide](https://github.com/CommandersAct/tcserverside-flutter-plugin). It provides essential base classes and foundational components necessary for their operation.

# versions compatibility : 

We are using fixed versions for the TCcore in our iOS podspec to prevent unwanted auto-upgrades that could cause issues when integrating with other modules. Please refer to the table below for version compatibility with each bridge version to avoid conflicts in CocoaPods.
